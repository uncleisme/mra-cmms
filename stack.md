ðŸ§± Suggested Stack for Your CMMS
Layer	Tool
Frontend	Flutter (mobile + web support)
Backend	Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime) - already have dataset
State Management	Riverpod (clean, scalable for Flutter)
Deployment : vercel
Notifications	Supabase Edge Functions + email/sms (e.g., via SendGrid, Twilio)


project: creating cmms flutter app that has 7 main views:
1. login - use supabase auth
2. register - use supabase auth
3. dashboard -key metrics
4. orders - to the work orders table in supabase
5. leaves - to the leaves table in supabase
6. settings - to the settings table in supabase
7. profile - to the profile table in supabase

use small widget
Use large touch targets

Support offline caching (with Hive or Drift)

Use clear status indicators

Add push/email notifications for urgent tasks
Hive â€“ lightweight, fast key-value store

Drift â€“ local SQL database

flutter_cache_manager â€“ for images or files

âœ… Strategy:

Cache data locally

Show changes in UI

Sync with Supabase when back online

reusable widget for the app especially for the forms, buttons, cards, etc

The best way to use widgets in Flutter involves adhering to principles that enhance performance, maintainability, and code readability.
Performance Optimization:
Use const constructors:
Employ const constructors on widgets whenever possible. This allows Flutter to perform optimizations by reusing existing widget instances, reducing rebuilds and improving performance.
Prefer StatelessWidget:
Use StatelessWidget for UI elements that do not require mutable state. They are simpler and more performant than StatefulWidget when no internal state changes are needed.
Code Structure and Reusability:
Create reusable widgets:
Break down complex UI into smaller, independent widgets. This promotes reusability, reduces code duplication, and makes the UI easier to manage and debug.
Follow naming conventions:
Adhere to Dart's naming conventions for classes, variables, and methods to maintain consistency and readability.
Avoid deep widget trees:
Instead of nesting many widgets within a single build method, create separate, dedicated widgets for distinct parts of the UI. This improves readability and makes it easier for Flutter to optimize rebuilds.
Layout and Design:
Utilize layout widgets:
Leverage Flutter's rich set of layout widgets (e.g., Row, Column, Stack, Padding, Center) to arrange and position other widgets effectively.
Separate concerns:
Define themes, routes, and other global configurations in separate files for better organization and maintainability.
Avoid hardcoded values:
Internationalize your app by avoiding hardcoded strings and styles. Use theme data and asset management for consistent styling and localization.
State Management:
Manage state appropriately:
For widgets with mutable state, use StatefulWidget and manage state changes within the State class. Consider using state management solutions like Provider or BLoC for more complex applications.
Proper setState() usage:
Call setState() only when necessary to trigger a rebuild of the relevant part of the UI. Avoid unnecessary setState() calls, especially within loops or frequently called methods.
By following these best practices, you can effectively leverage Flutter's widget-based architecture to build performant, maintainable, and scalable applications.
